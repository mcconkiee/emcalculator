quick stab at a calculator

yeah yeah yeah...i'll move the stuff out of the view later....

This calculator was written for 3 reasons:

* we needed a ***basic*** calculator that was skimable
* it needed to update on *operator*. e.g.	User taps `5 + 5 + 2`. Obviously on `=` the display will ready 12. However on pressing the 2nd `+` we needed this to calculate and update the display so it would read `10` before the user presses the next digit/decimal
* there were 2 keys hard to find in an open source solution

	- **&#9003;** backspace
	- **+/-** toggle
	
	
and there you go.
